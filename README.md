_Concept Â· UI/UX-Design Â· Development_ of an website dedicated to raising **awareness** about **POF syndrome**, built with modern web technologies â€“ _React Â· Next.js Â· Styled Components_.

### Goal

The goal is to make the content **approachable**, **easy to understand**, and **less overwhelming**, while offering both **education** and **hope** to those affected.
